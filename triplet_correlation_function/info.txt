The functions provided in this code employ the Kirkwood-Superposition-Principle for determining the triplet correlation:
 
    g(r,s,t): Where r is the distance between p1 to p2, s the distance between p1 and p3, and t the distance between p2 and p3.
    In this case p1 is the central particle with neighbors p1 and p2.
    Both the self and non-self correlation functions assume r=s, with t being determined by the angle formed between the vectors p1:p2 and p1:p3
    Consequently the distance "t" is determined based upon the cosine rule as t**2 = r**2 *( 2 *( 1 -cos(theta)))
    g(r,s,t) whre r=s=t implies an equilateral configuration with a theta = 60 degrees.
